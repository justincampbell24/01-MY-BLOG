# About Me

Hello, my name is Justin Campbell.

I am currently studying Agribusiness, Animal Science, and Accounting at College of the Ozarks.

I live and work on our family farm in Hartville, Missouri. The ranch encompasses about 4000 acres in Wright County. We raise cattle, horses, chickens, and grow row crops and hay crops. About 750 cow-calf pairs currently call the ranch home. We raise several different breeds of cattle including Herefords, Angus, Red Angus, Brangus, Gelbvieh, Red Gelbvieh, and Charolais, but we crossbreed almost all of these. Angus and Herefords make up the majority of our cattle as they are the two foundation breeds of our operation.

I am by no means an expert in any agricultural field, but I can give some insight into what we do on our operation. I hope you enjoy my blog and if you have any questions, ask away!
