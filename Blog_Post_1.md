# A Snapshot of a Southwest Missouri Beef Cattle Operation

### Topic: Personal Blog of my family farm

This blog gives people who have never experienced farming and ranching a small look into a cattle operation. Our operation consists of about 750 cow and calf pairs. This gives me experience in raising cattle and the different practices utilized. Many individuals do not understand where their food comes from or how it is produced. I hope to provide some insight for those people on practices used on our farm that leads ultimately to the consumers table. This blog will discuss processes and techniques used by our operation, however, not every cattle ranch will usee the same techniques, so this blog is more of a snapshot of operations in Southwest Missouri, in particular Campbell Ranch. The goal of the blog is that readers will walk away with a better sense of how animals are raised and the process of products from the farm to the consumers table.

The blog posts will include information on cattle raised, grazing techniques, feed rations, hay practices and feeding, and overall care of cattle. Also included will be the whole process of a calf all the way to butcher. Feed ration ingredients that are used commonly by our operations as well as many others will also be included in the blog. I will also discuss the advantages of taking care of pastures and hayfields. Different breeds, common crossbreeds, and advantages to different breeds will be discussed in the blog as well. I will also provide a detailed cover of medical care of the animals. I will discuss the advantages of diversifying an operation with animals. I will also cover the cycle of using resources and then giving resources back in the same sense of gifting an equal value gift to someone.

If one person walks away with a better understanding of agriculture and its processes, then this blog was successful.
