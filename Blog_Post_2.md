# Calving Season

Calving Season can be one of the most stressful but most beautiful times of the year. When hundreds of cows are giving birth in a short period of time, the work can be stressful trying to keep up with so many new calves. The chance to see the natural wonder of birth easily outweighs the stress. Nothing beats being able to watch a calf try to stand for the first time.

Typically, there are two calving seasons each year, one in the fall and one in the spring. We try to split our cattle 50/50 between fall scheduled calving and spring scheduled calving. The advantage to splitting the calving schedule is receiving two checks when the calves are sold versus just one lump sum. Two checks at different parts of the year makes it easier to pay the ranch’s bills. Two calving seasons also allows us to rotate breeding stock more effectively. 

Depending on the age of cows, we separate them on number of births. If a cow has not given birth before, it is referred to as a heifer. We keep all the First Calf Heifers, so cows pregnant with their first calf, together and close to home. This allows us to check the heifers often throughout the day and night as well as help them if they are struggling to give birth. Heifers usually struggle to give birth for the first time, so sometimes we must pull the calf out of the womb. Normally, the heifer should be allowed an hour or so of pushing during birth before we even consider interfering. Once heifers give birth, them and their calf are separated into another pasture after a few days of holding them in the barn. Any cow that has given birth before resides in their respective herd in a pasture throughout the ranch. 

We check the older mothers daily, matching new calves with their mothers. We tag each calf, writing down their identification number on a spreadsheet with their mother’s identification number. The spreadsheet I mentioned allows us to track the mother’s history and the calves’ progression. Bulls get a tag in their left ear, and heifers get a tag in their right ear. Catching calves can prove to be somewhat difficult but also fun. Calf-catches, ropes, Ride-a-long chutes, and bulldogging are the tools or techniques commonly used to capture calves. A calf-catch is basically an extendable shepherds’ staff, ride-a-long chutes attach to the side of an ATV, and bulldogging is tackling the calf. We either bulldog or use a calf-catch. 

Calves are susceptible to illnesses, so we keep common treatments for sickness in truck with us. Some diseases that calves commonly contract are pneumonia and diarrhea (scours). If we see calves with symptoms of these illnesses, wee treat them. For example, if a calf is coughing, we will treat it with something like [LA-300](https://www.drugs.com/pro/noromycin-300-la.html). Taking proper care of calves is vital to the success of the ranch.
