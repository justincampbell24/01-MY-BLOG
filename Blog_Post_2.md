# Calving Season

Calving season can be one of the most beautiful times of the year. The chance to see the birth of a new life is priceless. At the same time, we have several herds of cows calving out. During calving season, we check the cows every day. We tag newborn calves, left ear for males and right ear for females. The males are usually castrated with a banding system unless they are deemed superior. If they are kept as bulls, then they will go through a different process than the rest of the calves. We must catch the calves in the field to process them for the first time, and there are a couple different ways to catch a calf. Calf catches, ropes, ride-a-long chute, and bulldogging are a few different ways to catch newborn calves. Calf catches are essentially an extendable shepherds’ staff. Ride-a-long chutes attach to an ATV and allow you to just drive up next to the calf and secure it. Bulldogging is tackling the calf and holding it. After the calf has been processed, we take record of it and its mother. We have a spreadsheet that we write the calf’s identification number next to the mother’s identification number. This allows us to keep accurate records of our cattle and see the history of the cows. It is essential to know how many cows and calves there are in a pasture at any given time. This makes it easier to know if some are missing or if there are new calves. Good record keeping streamlines this process. Since baby calves are prone to illness, we carry an assortment of antibiotics and other treatments in the vehicle with us. For example, if a calf has scours, diarrhea, we can treat it because we keep scour boluses in our truck with us. Calving season is a hectic often stressful time of year. A careful watch over the cows and newborn calves is kept because of how susceptible newborn calves are to dangers such as predators and illness.
