# Breeding

The foundation for a successful ranch is the breeding program. A good program can establish the ranch as a reputable place to buy cattle from. 
The breeds that we raise include:
- [Hereford](https://hereford.org/)
- [Angus](http://www.angus.org/)
- [Charolais](http://charolaisusa.com/)
- [Brangus](https://gobrangus.com/)
- [Balancer](https://www.gelbvieh.org/about/edge)
- [Red Angus](https://redangus.org/)
- [Gelbvieh](https://www.gelbvieh.org/)
- [Red Gelbvieh](https://www.gelbvieh.org/)
- [Beefmaster](https://www.gelbvieh.org/)
- Soon to be [Senepol](http://www.senepolcattle.com/)

We crossbreed most of our cattle to maximize [heterosis](https://www.britannica.com/science/heterosis). Crossbreeding means that we take two different breeds and breed them to each other. For example, we breed Hereford bulls to Angus cows frequently. This results in what is called a baldie. Hybrid Vigor or heterosis means the offspring has genes that are better than both parents. Baldies are known for excellent hybrid vigor.

As far as breeding practices go there is two popular ways. Natural breeding is allowing bulls to breed cows in the pasture. This is the most common method of breeding in the beef cattle industry. The other method that is relatively common is [Artificial Insemination](http://www.thebeefsite.com/articles/721/artificial-insemination-for-beef-cattle/) (AI). AI is the process of taking live sperm cells from a bull and inserting into the female’s reproductive tract. Some advantages of using AI are no need for a bull, can choose the best sires, and better record keeping. 

When breeding cows, it is important to notice when the cow comes into heat. Heat is when the cow is fertile and ready to be bred. Catching a cow in heat is especially important when using AI since we must manually insert the semen into the cow. When using natural breeding, the bulls can sense when cows are in heat.

Bulls are introduced to the herds for two seasons a year for about two and half months or 75 days. This almost guarantees that the bulls were present when every cow came into heat at least once. When the bulls are not being used they are kept in a “bachelor” pasture with the rest of the bulls not being used.
